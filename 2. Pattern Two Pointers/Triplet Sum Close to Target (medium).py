'''
Triplet Sum Close to Target (medium)
Problem Statement
Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the target number as possible, return the sum of the triplet.
If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum.
Example 1:
Input: [-2, 0, 1, 2], target=2
Output: 1
Explanation: The triplet [-2, 1, 2] has the closest sum to the target.
Example 2:
Input: [-3, -1, 1, 2], target=1
Output: 0
Explanation: The triplet [-3, 1, 2] has the closest sum to the target.
Example 3:
Input: [1, 0, 1, 1], target=100
Output: 3
Explanation: The triplet [1, 1, 1] has the closest sum to the target.

Aim of this problem is to reduce distance between sum and target. return element wherever you find difference is min. If we want to find minimum diff, ultimetely it means we want to find max sum.
take example [-1 2 1 -4] and target = 1

possible combinations of triplets:
-1 2  1 sum = 2  difference = target - sum = 1 - 2 = -1
-1 1 -4 sum = -4 difference = 1 - (-4) = 5
 2 1 -4 sum = -1 difference = 1 - (-1) = 2

In above solution minimum diff we see is -1. Here is difference can be seen as distance between two so sign doesnt matter. consider absolute of diff and see which one is minimum. Wherever diff is minimum, sum will be the biggest. Hence return sum where diff is minimum.

There two possibility of tracking:-
1. biggest sum
2. smallest diff between target and sum.

First one is easier for understanding and coding.

'''
Time complexity
Sorting the array will take O(N* logN)O(Nâˆ—logN). Overall searchTriplet() will take O(N * logN + N^2),
which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).
Space complexity
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting.
