Problem Challenge 2
Rearrange a LinkedList (medium)
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.
Your algorithm should not use any extra space and the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.
Example 1:
Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> null
Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null
Example 2:
Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> null
Output: 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> null

'''
Time Complexity
The above algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
Space Complexity
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
